=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<AnyEvent::Ping::DGRAM> is an asynchronous AnyEvent pinger.

It is a subclass of L<AnyEvent::Ping> that does not require the code to run
under root.

=head1 Running On Linux

This class depends on the DGRAM style icmp ping socket that linux provides.
Doing so allows your code to run as a non-root user.  However, you will need to
whitelist a group that the code's user is in.  The relevent sysctl takes a range
of groups:

   echo '0 2000' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range
   
or to make it last between reboots:

   echo "net.ipv4.ping_group_range=0 2000" > /etc/sysctl.d/60-icmp-ping.conf
   /etc/init.d/procps restart
